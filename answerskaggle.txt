I used Naive Bayes classification for my Kaggle classification. It trains off the given training data and then used its data to determine the classification of the test data. I did not stem or remove stopwords in my initial attempt and scored 70.83%.

Given my results for the truth/lie detection in part one of the assignment, I thought that using Naive Bayes and stemming the words would increase detection probability. Oddly, however, I received worse results with stemming, and only scored 70.27%.

After testing out Naive Bayes with stemming I decided to revert back to using Naive Bayes without stemming, which scored 70.83%.
